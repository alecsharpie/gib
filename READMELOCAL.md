# Local Model

This is still a work in progress. The model is not included in the repository.

```
The model I plan to use is the [Q4_K_M.gguf](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-v0.1-GGUF/blob/main/mistral-7b-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf) version (medium, balanced quality - recommended) of [Mistral 7B](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/ ) from [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-v0.1-GGUF) on Hugging Face.
